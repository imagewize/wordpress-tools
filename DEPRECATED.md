# Repository Deprecated

**This repository has been merged into [wp-ops](https://github.com/imagewize/wp-ops).**

All tools and documentation from this repository have been integrated into the main WordPress operations repository for better organization and unified maintenance.

## Migration Mapping

The contents of this repository have been relocated as follows:

| Original Location | New Location in wp-ops |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| `age-verification/` | `wordpress-utilities/age-verification/` |
| `analytics/` | `wp-cli/analytics/` |
| `speed-optimization/` | `wp-cli/speed-optimization/` |
| `migrations/migration-urls-update.md` | `wp-cli/migration/URL-UPDATE-METHODS.md` |

## Why This Change?

The **wordpress-tools** repository focused on application-level WordPress utilities, while **wp-ops** handled infrastructure and server management. Merging them creates a complete WordPress operations toolkit:

- **Single source of truth** for all WordPress development and operations
- **Unified documentation** style and navigation
- **Easier maintenance** with one repository instead of two
- **Better discoverability** for all tools in one place

## Next Steps

Please update your bookmarks and references to point to the [wp-ops repository](https://github.com/imagewize/wp-ops).
